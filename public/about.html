<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate and detail-oriented Master’s
   student in Computer Information Technology,
    graduating in May 2025, with hands-on experience in
     software testing and a strong drive to grow in the 
     tech industry. My background includes manual testing
     in VM, SIT, and UAT environments, using tools like 
     JIRA for efficient issue tracking and resolution.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m deepening my skills in Java,
   Data Structures and Algorithms, SQL, HTML, and CSS
    to build a solid foundation for
     full-stack development. I’m also working on a 
     personal project, CalorieMeater—a calorie-counting 
     web application that integrates these technologies, 
    designed to demonstrate both my technical abilities 
    and user-centered thinking.</p>

<p>I’m enthusiastic about continuous learning, 
  improving my communication skills, and exploring 
  emerging tech trends like AI and their impact on IT 
  careers. I’m now actively seeking full-time opportunities
   where I can contribute, grow, and 
  bring thoughtful solutions to complex problems.</p>
